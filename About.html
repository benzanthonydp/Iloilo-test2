            <p>Iloilo is a province of the Philippines, located in the center of the Philippine archipelago. The
                province comprises the southeastern part of Panay Island with island-province of Guimaras just across
                its coast. The capital city of the province of Iloilo is the City of Iloilo, which is also one of the
                major urban centers in the Philippines. It is nicknamed “the Heart of the Philippines”.</p>

            <h2>Heritage</h2>
            <p>Iloilo has always been one of the country’s most important provinces. Merchants from China and India have
                long traded with the Ilonggos even before the Spaniards came; evidences of this flourishing civilization
                are displayed in Museums and Private Galleries. Even during the Spanish and American colonial period,
                Iloilo still proved to be an important trading post. Iloilo has a beautiful harbor with serene and calm
                waters, safe for navigation because it is protected from the open sea by scenic Guimaras Island. This
                excellent port facility made Iloilo the center of trade at the turn of the century, with the whole world
                doing business in this port especially during the heyday of the sugar industry. In fact, Iloilo was
                given the title of “Queen City of the South” for being the Philippine’s second city, after Manila.</p>

            <p>You can still see the old buildings that surprisingly are European and American
                inspired such as stately mansions, majestic century-old churches, and heritage commercial buildings.</p>

                enchanting folklores.</p>
