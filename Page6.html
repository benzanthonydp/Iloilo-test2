            <div class="line"></div>

            <h4 class="custom-heading">Iloilo Riverside Blvd, Mandurrio, Iloilo City, Iloilo</h4>

            <p class="no-margin">A calm promenade that surrounds the Iloilo River is known as the Iloilo Esplanade, or
                simply the esplanade among locals. It is one of the best examples of how the city is working to maintain
                and restore the Iloilo River and encourage active living. It's a well-liked tourist destination where
                people can take a leisurely stroll and take in the peaceful scenery along the river.</p>

            <p class="no-margin">Taxis and jeepneys make it simple to get to the Iloilo Esplanade. In the Mandurriao
                area, the eastern end is located along Diversion Road (Benigno Aquino Avenue). On the Leganes, SM
                Mandurriao, Ungka UI, City Proper, and Santa Barbara routes, jeepneys are available to take you there.
                Take the footpath on Riverside Boardwalk as a shortcut if you're coming from Smallville or Atria Park
                District</p>

            <h2>Best time to visit</h2>
            <p class="no-margin">When the sun is low in the sky and the twilight glows softly in the early morning and
                late afternoon. Around this time, locals usually go to the esplanade for a robust jog or to hang out
                with friends and family in the nearby coffee shops and restaurants.</p>
