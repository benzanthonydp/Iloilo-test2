            <h4 class="custom-heading">Camina Balay nga Bato, Osmena Street, Villa Arevalo District, Iloilo City</h4>

            <p class="no-margin">One of the top tourist destinations in Iloilo City is the lovely ancestral home known
                as Camina Balay Nga Bato. It was constructed between 1860 and 1865, and its name means "home beside the
                river." Previously, it served as Femundo Avancena and Eulalia Abaja's modest home. The house's design
                was inspired by the bahay kubo. Although there have been upgrades and alterations over the years, the
                house itself has endured.</p>

            <p class="no-margin">For those who enjoy all things retro, the house is a visual treat. There are altars,
                pottery, relics, ancient furniture, and old pictures. Weavers utilize looms on the bottom level to
                create fabrics that will be sold at the home. Additionally, handicrafts including shawls, patadyongs,
                and slippers are available for purchase.</p>
